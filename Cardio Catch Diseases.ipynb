    "## Cardio Catch Diseases ( CCD ) company\n",
    "\n",
    "Cadio Catch Diseases is a company that specializes in detecting early-stage heart disease. Its business model is of the Service type, that is, the company offers the early diagnosis of a cardiovascular disease for a certain price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is made manually by a team of specialists. The current accuracy of the diagnosis varies between 55% and 65%, due to the complexity of the diagnosis and also the fatigue of the staff who take turns to minimize the risks. The cost of each diagnosis, including equipment and analysts' payroll, is around `R$1,000.00`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price of the diagnosis, paid by the client, varies according to the accuracy achieved by the specialists' time, the client pays `R$ 500.00` for each 5% accuracy above 50%. For example, for an accuracy of 55% the diagnosis costs the customer `$500.00`, for an accuracy of 60% the value is `$1000.00`, and so on. If the diagnostic accuracy for 50% of the customer does not pay for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the variation in accuracy given by the time of specialists means that the company now has an operation with profit, revenue greater than the cost, or an operation with a loss, revenue less than the cost. This diagnostic instability causes the company to have an unpredictable Cashflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal as the Data Scientist hired by Cardio Catch Diseases is to create a tool that increases diagnostic accuracy and that accuracy is stable for all diagnoses.\n",
    "\n",
    "So your job as Data Scientist is to create a patient classification tool, like a stable accuracy. Along with the tool, you need to submit a report to the CEO of Cardio Catch Diseases reporting the results and answering the following questions: (He will likely ask these questions on the day of your presentation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the Accuracy and Precision of the tool?\n",
    "2. How much profit will Cardio Catch Diseases have with the new tool?\n",
    "3. How reliable is the result given by the new tool?\n",
